pgFormatter - PostgreSQL SQL syntax beautifier

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This SQL formatter/beautifier supports keywords from SQL-92, SQL-99,
SQL-2003, SQL-2008, SQL-2011 and PostgreSQL specifics keywords. May works
with any other databases too.

pgFormatter can work as a console program or as a CGI. It will automatically
detect his environment and output as text or as HTML following the context.

Keywords highlighting will only be available in CGI context.

=head2 Terminal/console execution

Usage: pg_format [options] file.sql

    PostgreSQL SQL queries and PL/PGSQL code beautifier.

Arguments:

    file.sql can be a file or use - to read query from stdin.

    Returning the SQL formatted to stdout or into a file specified with
    the -o | --ouput option.

Options:

    -a | --anonymize      : obscure all literals in queries, useful to hide
                            confidential data before formatting.
    -b | --comma-start    : in a parameters list, start with the comma (see -e)
    -d | --debug          : enable debug mode. Disabled by default.
    -e | --comma-end      : in a parameters list, end with the comma (default)
    -f | --function-case N: Change the case of the reserved keyword. Default is
                            unchanged: 0. Values: 0=>unchanged, 1=>lowercase,
                            2=>uppercase, 3=>capitalize.
    -F | --format STR     : output format: text or html. Default: text.
    -h | --help           : show this message and exit.
    -m | --maxlength SIZE : maximum length of a query, it will be cutted above
                            the given size. Default: no truncate.
    -n | --nocomment      : remove any comment from SQL code.
    -o | --output file    : define the filename for the output. Default: stdout.
    -p | --placeholder re : set regex to find code that must not be changed.
    -s | --spaces size    : change space indent, default 4 spaces.
    -S | --separator STR  : dynamic code separator, default to single quote.
    -u | --keyword-case N : Change the case of the reserved keyword. Default is
                            uppercase: 2. Values: 0=>unchanged, 1=>lowercase,
                            2=>uppercase, 3=>capitalize.
    -v | --version        : show pg_format version and exit.

Examples:

    cat samples/ex1.sql | pg_format -
    pg_format -n samples/ex1.sql
    pg_format -f 2 -n -o result.sql samples/ex1.sql

=head2 CGI context

Install pg_format into your cgi-bin folder, grant execution on it as a CGI
script (maybe you should add the .cgi extension) and get it from your favorite
browser.

You have a live example without limitation than ten thousand characters in
your SQL query here:

	http://sqlformat.darold.net/

pg_format will automatically detected that it is running in a CGI environment
and will output all html code needed to run an online code formatter site.
There's nothing more to do.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Download the tarball from github and unpack the archive as follow:

	tar xzf pgFormatter-x.x.tar.gz
	cd pgFormatter-x.x/
	perl Makefile.PL
	make && sudo make install

This will copy the Perl script pg_format in /usr/local/bin/pg_format directory
by default and the man page into /usr/local/share/man/man1/pg_format.1. Those are
the default installation directory for 'site' install.

If you want to install all under /usr/ location, use INSTALLDIRS='perl' as argument
of Makefile.PL. The script will be installed into /usr/bin/pg_format and the
manpage into /usr/share/man/man1/pg_format.1.

For example, to install everything just like Debian does, proceed as follow:

	perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor

By default INSTALLDIRS is set to site.

=head1 HINTS

=head2 Formatting from VI

With pgFormatter, you can just add the following line to your ~/.vimrc file:

	au FileType sql setl formatprg=/usr/local/bin/pg_format\ -

This lets your gq commands use pgFormatter automagically. For example if you
are on the first line, typing:

	ESC+gq+G

will format the entire file.

	ESC+gq+2j

will format the next two line.

Thanks to David Fetter for the hint.

=head2 Prevent replacing code snippets

Using -p or --placeholder command line option it is possible to keep code
untouched by pgFormatter in your SQL queries. For example, in query like:

	SELECT * FROM projects WHERE projectnumber
		IN <<internalprojects>> AND username = <<loginname>>;

you may want pgFormatter to not interpret << and >> as bit-shift keywords
and modify your code snippsets. You can use a Perl regular expression to
instruct pgFormatter to keep some part of the query untouched. For example:

	pg_format samples/ex9.sql -p '<<(?:.*)?>>'

will not format the bit-shift like operators.

=head2 Prevent dynamic code formatting

By default pgFormatter takes all code between single quote as string constant
and do not perform any formatting on this code. It is common to use a string
as code separator to avoid doubling single quote in dynamic code generation,
in this case pgFormatter can fail to auto detect the code separator. By
default it will search for any string after the EXECUTE keyword starting with
dollar sign. If it can not auto detect your code separator you can use the
command line option -S or --separator to set the code separator that must be
used.
