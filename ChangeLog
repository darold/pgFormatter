January 23 2017 - v1.6

This release fixes several issues and adds lot of improvements in
query formatting.

Command line option --placeholder or -p has been added to be able
to set regex to find code that must not be formatted. For example,
in query like:

	SELECT * FROM projects WHERE projectnumber
		IN <<internalprojects>> AND username = <<loginname>>;

you may want pgFormatter to not interpret << and >> as bit-shift
keywords and modify your code snippsets. You can use a Perl regular
expression to instruct pgFormatter to keep some part of the query
untouched. For example:

        pg_format samples/ex9.sql -p '<<(?:.*)?>>'

will not format the bit-shift like operators.

Here is the complete list of changes:

  - Improve SQL formatting by reducing space with parenthesis and
    cast with ::.
  - Add two sample file to test placeholder feature and WITH query.
  - Fix missing newline after INNER JOIN. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud
    for the report.
  - Fix whitespace placed in between the E and the quote character.
    Thanks to clijunky for the report.
  - Fix lots of operators reported on issue #22. Thanks to Laurenz
    Albe for the report and list of missing operators.
  - Fix version number in lib/pgFormatter library files.
  - Add -p | --placeholder command line option to prevent pgFormatter
    to replace some part of the SQL queries. Thanks to jhelberg for
    the feature request.
  - Fix bad formatting with anonymized values in queries. Thanks to
    Pilat66 for the report.

October 17 2015 - v1.5

This release fixes several issues and adds support to new keywords added in
PostgreSQL 9.5. There's also a major code rewrite by Hubert depesz Lubaczewski,
pg_format works as previously - handles both CGI and CLI interface, but you
can get directly to whatever functionality you want by using pgFormatter::*
modules.

New beautified keywords are: BERNOULLI, CUBE, GROUPING SETS, SKIP LOCKED,
LOGGED, POLICY, ROLLUP, TABLESAMPLE. And new functions are: jsonb_pretty,
jsonb_set, pg_last_committed_xact, pg_xact_commit_timestamp.

There is also a useful hint added to documentation to be able to format
you SQL code from vi by adding a simple line to .vimrc. This hint is taken
from David Fetter's blog : http://people.planetpostgresql.org/dfetter/index.php?/archives/78-Formatting!.html
 
Here is the complete list of other changes:
 
  - Add useful hint about formating in vi. Thanks to David Fetter for the hint.
  - Prevent newline after open parenthesis and indent back after close when we have count(*) for example.
  - Add test query with a backslash before a quote in samples/ex8.sql.
  - Fix coloring string when the string contained a backslash before a quote. Thanks to Kevin Brannen for the patch.
  - Add RETURNS keywords.
  - Remove newline before the FOR keywords.
  - Add BY to the list of PG keywords to be capitalized.

  - Fix wrong indentation with function that accept FROM clause. Thanks to Adrian Klaver and Alvaro Herrera for the report.
  - Add more test samples about json operators.
  - Add JSON #>> operator and sample. Thanks to Tom Burnett for the patch.
  - Some more JSON operators. Thanks to Hubert depesz Lubaczewski for the patch.
  - JSON operators have to be before normal operators as regexp will match first possible string, so -> will match - first, if it's before in tokenizer. Changing order solves the problem reports by Tom Burnett. Thanks to Hubert depesz Lubaczewski for the patch.
  - Add new json/jsonb functions to list of pg functions.
  - Add JSON operators. Thanks to Tom Burnett for the report.
  - Fix anonymizing failure reported in issue #15. Thanks to Niklas Schmidtmer for the report.

  - Fix Beautify.pm with perl 5.20. Thanks to Hubert depesz Lubaczewski for the patch.
  - In Beautify.pm we were not considering the possibility of $last being empty in one condition inside a JOIN, and that gives an exception in perl 5.20. Thanks to Pablo Alvarez de Sotomayor Posadillo for the patch.
  - Split into libraries and programs complete. Thanks to Hubert depesz Lubaczewski for the patch.

    Regex that has a look-ahead or look-behind AND uses the "i" modifier
